--------------------------------------------------------

Tables S1 and S2 from Ozkan et al., Cell 2013.
S1 = individual protein information
S2 = interacting protein pairs

note, hand edited so R read.table() doesn't throw errors and tables are in sync.
* table s1: "5'-end" changed to "5-prime end"
* table S2: CG31369 changed to CG43462 (used in table S1 and current flybase)
* table S2: iHog to ihog (matches table_S1 and current flybase)
* table S1: changed CG8779 to CG43079 (nrm)
* table S1: changed CG8355 (multiple entries) to CG43758 (sli)

- manually edited S1 to update FBgns
